## Course Meeting Times

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

## Definition

Technology that deals with soil (and rock) as an engineering material in civil engineering projects.

## Examples of Application Areas

1. Foundations    
      
    - "shallow" e.g., spread footings for buildings
    - "deep" e.g., piles for offshore platform
2. Earth Structures    
      
    - Compacted earth fill for dam
    - Landfill for waste storage
3. Slopes and Excavations    
      
    - Cut slopes for highway
    - Excavation for subway
4. Retaining Structures    
      
    - Slurry wall with tieback anchors
    - Gravity retaining wall
5. Remediation of Contaminated Soil and Groundwater

## Types of Input Required to Solve Above Problems (for Soil)

1. **Geology and Exploration**: General nature and extent of soils involved
2. **Soil Mechanics**: Evaluation of Engineering Properties of soils and Theoretical Analyses to predict behavior of "structure"
3. **Feasibility**: Economics, environmental, legal, practical
4. **Experience**: Regarding what has happened in the past - successes and failures
5. **Field Evaluation**: Measurements of actual performance to evaluate and possibly alter design during construction
6. **Engineering Judgment**: Combined with above - final solution (increasing use of reliability analyses to "formalize" process)

## What Makes Soil Mechanics Interesting and Challenging (CCL's opinion)

Soil amongst most variable and difficult of all materials to understand and model

1. Complex stress-strain (non-linear, irreversible)
2. Properties highly variable function of soil types and stress history
3. Properties change with time, stress, environment, …
4. Every site has different soil conditions - new challenge
5. Soil "hidden" underground and data on small fraction of deposit

Emphasis on testing (in field and in lab) plus field monitoring
